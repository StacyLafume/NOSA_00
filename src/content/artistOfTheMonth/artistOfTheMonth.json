[{"id":1696378560,"artist_name":"Tori Valle","exhibition_name":"Lost Grief","exhibition_date":"2023-06-02T00:05:18.366Z","artist_statement":"Tori Valle is a visual artist, designer, and educator. She grew up in\nVilla Victoria, a Puerto Rican enclave in Boston’s South End. She was\nintroduced to the Boston art scene through her participation in youth\nprograms as a Spoken Word Poet, competing statewide and\ninternationally. Her focus from performance to the visual arts\nshifted during her time at New York University Tisch School of the\nArts, where she graduated with a BFA in 2022. You can find her\ncreating, mentoring and laughing with teens at Artists for Humanity.","exhibition_statement":"This exhibition is a narrative experience. The pieces of work in this\nshow are intentionally sequenced to tell a story through three main\nthemes: Travel, Exploration, and Escape.\nThe show was inspired by Kendrick Lamar’s album Mr. Morale & the Big\nSteppers, Navy Blue’s album Song of Sage: Post Panic!, and Bessel van\nder Kolk’s book The Body Keeps the Score.\nThe pieces of work in this exhibition are created using acrylic,\naerosol, charcoal, ink, fabric, digital softwares, and interactive\nmedia. Each piece was imagined and created through the lens of\nchildhood, culture, identity, gender, community, history, and\ngenerational lineage.\nI dedicate my first solo exhibition to my niece, Laylani Rosa\nDelValle.","headshot":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696377898/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/VICTORIA_13_kexqxw.jpg","exhibition_poster":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368079/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_09_Image_0002_aist4g.jpg","exhibition_pieces":[{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696369266/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_11_Image_0001_kszpmy.jpg","image_title":"1","image_description":"1"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368087/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_10_Image_0003_vppvzg.jpg","image_title":"2","image_description":"2"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368085/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_10_Image_0002_qlqiyg.jpg","image_title":"3","image_description":"3"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368083/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_10_Image_0001_ovoa4m.jpg","image_title":"4","image_description":"4"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368079/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_09_Image_0002_aist4g.jpg","image_title":"5","image_description":"5"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368077/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_09_Image_0001_qq2hct.jpg","image_title":"6","image_description":"6"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367987/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_08_Image_0002_xm5l7u.jpg","image_title":"7","image_description":"7"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696368077/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_09_Image_0001_qq2hct.jpg","image_title":"8","image_description":"8"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367987/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_08_Image_0002_xm5l7u.jpg","image_title":"9","image_description":"9"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367985/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_08_Image_0001_q9mn4a.jpg","image_title":"10","image_description":"10"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367981/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_07_Image_0001_gu1rtq.jpg","image_title":"11","image_description":"11"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367979/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_06_Image_0002_fx15sk.jpg","image_title":"12","image_description":"12"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367977/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_06_Image_0001_f2fguk.jpg","image_title":"13","image_description":"131"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367975/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_05_Image_0002_xs8kyb.jpg","image_title":"14","image_description":"14"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367973/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_05_Image_0001_zy218l.jpg","image_title":"15","image_description":"15"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367971/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_04_Image_0003_fgrdlf.jpg","image_title":"16","image_description":"16"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367971/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_04_Image_0003_fgrdlf.jpg","image_title":"17","image_description":"17"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367970/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_04_Image_0002_q1fl59.jpg","image_title":"18","image_description":"18"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367968/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_04_Image_0001_s2j59v.jpg","image_title":"19","image_description":"19"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367966/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_03_Image_0003_zrrb0o.jpg","image_title":"20","image_description":"20"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367964/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_03_Image_0002_psjb5i.jpg","image_title":"21","image_description":"21"},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsjizcvxm/image/upload/v1696367963/Artist%20of%20the%20month/june2023/Exhibiton_Package_2__Page_03_Image_0001_tbm8xe.jpg","image_title":"23","image_description":"23"}]},{"id":1696378560,"artist_name":"Kris
