artist_statement: |-
  Tori Valle is a visual artist, designer, and educator. She grew up in
  Villa Victoria, a Puerto Rican enclave in Boston’s South End. She was
  introduced to the Boston art scene through her participation in youth
  programs as a Spoken Word Poet, competing statewide and
  internationally. Her focus from performance to the visual arts
  shifted during her time at New York University Tisch School of the
  Arts, where she graduated with a BFA in 2022. You can find her
  creating, mentoring and laughing with teens at Artists for Humanity.
exhibition_statement: |-
  This exhibition is a narrative experience. The pieces of work in this
  show are intentionally sequenced to tell a story through three main
  themes: Travel, Exploration, and Escape.
  The show was inspired by Kendrick Lamar’s album Mr. Morale & the Big
  Steppers, Navy Blue’s album Song of Sage: Post Panic!, and Bessel van
  der Kolk’s book The Body Keeps the Score.
  The pieces of work in this exhibition are created using acrylic,
  aerosol, charcoal, ink, fabric, digital softwares, and interactive
  media. Each piece was imagined and created through the lens of
  childhood, culture, identity, gender, community, history, and
  generational lineage.
  I dedicate my first solo exhibition to my niece, Laylani Rosa
  DelValle.
