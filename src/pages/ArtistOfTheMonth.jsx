                        Kris, Born 1994, Boston based photographer since 2015. Pronouns She/Her/Hers. Kris has her

                        photographer, Kris hopes to eventually develop her own practice in art therapy. Her biggest
                        muse behind her work are black people, especially black femmes. She strives to show the
                        versatility of the black community by capturing their personalities, culture, stories, &
                        experiences.</p>
